When you pass through all gateways within the time limit, you will be moved to an area to get prizes! There are #b3 stages#k to the gateways. The time limit is #r6 minutes#k, and after that the game will #bend automatically#k. [Up and Up] #rdoes not allow #bjumps, teleports#k, or #bhastes#k. More details can be provided within the game.",
